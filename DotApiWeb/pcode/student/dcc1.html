                <p>Adobe Dreamweaver is a proprietary web development application  developed by Adobe Systems. In the last couple of posts on HTML I've mentioned that you can  easily edit it in a text editor. You'd be forgiven for thinking that I don't  want to spend money on fancy WYSIWYG tools and that's why I'm so excited about  being able to edit HTML in notepad.&nbsp;<br>
                  In fact what I like about HTML being written  in plain text (unlike, for example, the formatting of Word documents) is that  it's easy to debug (in other words, to look behind the scenes and figure out  what's going on).<br>
                  Dreamweaver combines HTML and CSS plain text editing with a  WYSIWYG tool&nbsp;which lets you check progress as you go  or edit WYSIWYG on the fly. It's the industry standard tool for this sort of  thing, although there are many, many programs which do more-or-less the same  thing.</p>
